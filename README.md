# Frontend Test (React)

## Problem description

A company wants to provide meteorological services to their customers through a web portal that shows the metrics collected from many weather stations installed in the field. You were hired to develop a web application for managing the weather stations including the following features:

- Registry new stations based on the input: id(unique), name(unique), status(on/off), latitude and longitude;
- Remove a specific station;
- List all the stations;
- Display the metrics collected from a specific station in a chart: temperature (line) and rain volume (bar).

You received a JSON file (metrics.json) with metrics from few stations to help you develop the application. The application should be able to display the metrics (temperature and rain volume) from the stations which the **id** matches the data provided by metrics.json.

## Notes

You must implement the weather station management application following these guidelines:

- You must use **React** JavaScript framework;
- You can use CSS precompilers, like SASS, PostCSS, Stylus or Less, again, if you prefer;
- Automated tests are welcome and have a great value for us;
- It's nice to have a cool design, where responsive is more important;
- It's important that you create a README file containing information about how to setup and run the application.

## Sharing your solution

After finishing your implementation, push the code to a private git repository ([GitHub](https://github.com/pricing), [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) offer private repositories in their free tier account) and grant access to the person who is taking care of your hiring process.
