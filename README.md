# Frontend Test (React)

## Problem description

A company wants to provide meteorological services to their customers through a web portal from where they can manage their weather stations and see the data collected in the field. You were hired to develop a web application including the following features.

## Features

The user should be able to:
- Registry new stations based on the following input: id(unique), name(unique), status(on/off), latitude and longitude;
- Remove a specific station registered in the application;
- List all the stations registered in the application;
- See the data collected from a specific station in a chart. The metrics should be displayed in the same chart (temperature as line and rain volume as bar).

You received a JSON file (metrics.json) with data collected from few stations to help you develop the application. If the user registry a weather station with an **id** that matches the data provided by metrics.json, the chart should display the metrics for that station. Otherwise there will be no data to show.

## Notes

You must implement the web application following these guidelines:

- You must use **React** JavaScript framework;
- You can use CSS precompilers, like SASS, PostCSS, Stylus or Less, again, if you prefer;
- It's nice to have a cool design and it should be responsive;
- Unit tests are welcome and have a great value for us;
- It's important that you create a README file containing information about how to setup and run the application.

## Sharing your solution

After finishing your implementation, push the code to a private git repository ([GitHub](https://github.com/pricing), [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) offer private repositories in their free tier account) and grant access to the person who is taking care of your hiring process.
